# A Framework for Enhancing Media Literacy and Mitigating Cognitive Threats in Urban Governance

This repository contains a research prototype implementing a digital learning–based framework for enhancing media literacy and cognitive resilience in urban governance environments. The system integrates cognitive assessment, adaptive learning, and behavioral analysis to mitigate risks associated with misinformation and cognitively manipulative information.

## Overview
	•	Adaptive learning and content management
	•	Behavior analysis and feedback
	•	Alert and notification
	•	Management and analytics


The prototype operationalizes a conceptual framework proposed in an accompanying academic study. It supports the evaluation of cognitive vulnerabilities, delivery of personalized learning content, and analysis of user behavior for feedback and system-level insights.

## Core Modules
	•	Cognitive literacy assessment
## Architecture

The system follows a client–server architecture with a web-based frontend, backend services, and a centralized database. Authentication and access control are implemented using JSON Web Token (JWT).

## Roles
	•	Citizens: assessment and learning participation
	•	Domain experts: content and assessment management
	•	Managers: system administration and analytics

## Case Demonstration

A case-based scenario simulating misinformation propagation during an urban public service disruption is included to demonstrate practical applicability.
